My personal PopClip Extensions that I could not find elsewhere. You can use the installers or code the way you like it. 


##PopClip Extensions

1. TBP Search - The Pirate Bay Search from select text

*You can find other extensions in the official* [*PopClip Extensions Repository*](http://pilotmoon.com/popclip/extensions).


## Usage ##
Clone repository (or download individual extensions) and use `*.popclipextz` files to install plugins into [PopClip](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/popclip/id445189367?mt=12&uo=4&partnerId=30&siteID=vRL5rYo4h5A "PopClip")

Use the source code to create your own extension. It's easy. Here's a [tutorial](http://mac.tutsplus.com/tutorials/customization/create-your-own-custom-extension-for-popclip/).
